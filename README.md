# TooManyClerics

Villager careers are not evenly distributed in Vanilla Minecraft. Only 33% of newborn villagers will be Clerics or Nitwits; only 8% will be Librarians and only 4% will be Farmers.

This mod adjusts the villager spawn balance so that careers are distributed evenly. It also adds an optional Splash Potion of Amnesia which can be thrown at villagers to make them forget their profession and choose a new one.

This mod is intended to make it more feasible to maintain 'free range' villages without significantly altering the Vanilla experience.
